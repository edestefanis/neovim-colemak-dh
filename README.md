# Neovim Colemak-DH

At the same time I started using my first corne keyboard, I decided to try out a different layout. 

[Colemak DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) was the best I could find at the time, it allows keeping most fingers in the middle line of the keyboard, at least for writing in English.

I will upload here the json with my corne config, which I created in such a way that programming could have an "easier" adaptation (symbolis are ~ the same places, although of course I had to move around math symbols, ()[]{}, `'", and so on, but it wasn't that hard to get used to it at the end.
